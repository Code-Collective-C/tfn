                <p>This website ("the site") is the property of, and is published on the Internet
                    by, TruckFuelNet ("TFN"). The site is intended to provide an overview of the businesses of
                    TruckFuelNet, its
                    subsidiaries (including but not limited to TFN) and its associated companies (together "the
                    TruckFuelNet
                    Companies"). Access to and use of the site or any information it contains is subject to the
                    terms set out in
                    this notice ("the terms"). By signifying your acceptance of the terms, you represent that you
                    have full
                    legal capacity to agree to be bound by them, and your access to the site will be granted in
                    reliance on that
                    representation. If you are unwilling to agree to the terms, or do not have the capacity to do
                    so, you are
                    not entitled to access the site or to view or use any information it contains. The benefits of
                    the terms
                    extend to each of the TruckFuelNet Companies without notice of acceptance, which you are deemed
                    to have
                    waived.</p>

                    about the
                    TruckFuelNet Companies on the site, it gives no undertaking in that regard, and by your
                    acceptance of the
                    terms you exempt the TruckFuelNet Companies from liability for the accuracy or completeness of
                    the
                    information contained on the site. Should you wish to rely on anything appearing on the site,
                    you should
                    contact the relevant TruckFuelNet Company for written confirmation of it.</p>
